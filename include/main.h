// This code applies to the Arduino Nano platform.
//
// This code demonstrates how to drive HO-scale train signals. LEDs are wired to the Arduino with a resistor.
// The program applies a "lamp" effect on any LED using digital output in co-working mode.
// Based on POV, it gives the human eye the impression of a fading effect.
// This effect is applied in cooperative mode, which means fast-switching to emulate threads using the excellent AceRoutine library.
//
// This code drives 3 DB Signals in demo mode, cycling through available states on and off with fading effects.
//
// See README.md for hardware, configuration, references, and explanations.
